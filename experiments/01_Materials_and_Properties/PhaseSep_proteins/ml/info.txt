Feature(s): 'Sequence' column
    translate to one hot encoding?

target: min_plus,min_pdb,pdb_plus
    to binary classes here refers to the database of the protein
    three different datasets (min, plus, pdb) so three different binary classifications, i.e., the targets

    for instance in the 'min_plus' column: Sequences with '1' are from the 'plus' database, Sequences with a '0' are from the 'min' database. Here, the Sequences of the 'pdb' dataset are 'nan'.
