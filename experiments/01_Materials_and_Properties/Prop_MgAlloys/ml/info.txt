Feature(s): 'total_string' column
    this is a concatenated string from various features, both categorcial and numerical, used for LLM experiments.

    original python code:
    string = TEMPLATE.format(
            proccess= entry['Prozessbedingung'],
            homo_temp = entry['homogenized_temperature'],
            homo_time = entry['homogenized_time'],
            sol_time = entry['solutionized_time'], 
            sol_temp = entry['solutionized_temperature'],
            ext_temp = entry['extrution_temperature'],
            ext_speed = entry['extrution_speed'], 
            ext_ratio = entry['extrusion_ratio'],
            concentrations = entry['concentration_string']
            )
    
    categorical columns: (to one hot encoding)
        Prozessbedingung
    numerical columns: (use as is)
        homogenized_temperature
        homogenized_time
        solutionized_time
        solutionized_temperature
        extrution_temperature
        extrution_speed
        extrusion_ratio
    The following columsn are the contents of the various metals: (use as is)
        Fe,Cu,Ni,Nd,Zn,Ca,Al,Sn,Mn,Si,Gd,Y,Zr,
        (keep '0' even if metal is not included)

target: grain_size_bin_25.7,second_phase_bin_1.14
    binary classes (the numbers of in the column name are the medians of the target)
    so two experiments, one predicting the grain size, one predicting the second phase
    
NOTE: 
the HEREON_final.csv file has all the entries

the HEREON_extruded_final.csv is a subset of the total dataset, i.e. for all entries here the 'Prozessbedingung' is 'Extruded'
